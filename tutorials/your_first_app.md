# Your first application
This tutotial will help you creating your first application. An application is a program that executes a bunch of actions. These actions allow you to do stuff like working with servers, routing, etc. Before you can start writing code you need to choose the project folder you will use for your project related files. It is a good idea to use an empty folder as project folder so there won't be any compatibility issues. Read the previous tutorials if you haven't yet installed NodeJS and the basic cerus module. Now everything is installed and ready, you can create a new file with a name of your choosing. Keep in mind the extension of the file needs to be ".js" for it to be recognized as a javascript file. If this is new to you it is suggested to learn some javascript before continuing with these tutorials. 
Now everything is set up you can add the following line of code to your file:
```javascript
var cerus = require("cerus")();
```
Even though this doesn't look like much this line is actually really important. It first requires the basic cerus module. When this module has been loaded it will initialize it. This means that the cerus module will start adding all the default packages. These packages will also be initialized when they're loaded. The initialized class will then be returned to the cerus variable. This line won't produce everything noticable, but that will come in the next tutorials.
